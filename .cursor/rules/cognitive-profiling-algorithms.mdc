Core Cognitive Assessment System:

1. Brain Type Calculator (src/lib/brainTypeCalculator.ts)
Importance Score: 95
- Calculates primary and secondary brain types from quiz responses
- Maps OCEAN scores to 16 distinct cognitive profiles
- Processes ADHD and ASD indicator scores
- Computes stimulant sensitivity levels
- Generates weighted channel recommendations based on cognitive patterns

2. OCEAN Scoring Engine (src/components/OnboardingQuiz.tsx)
Importance Score: 90
- Processes personality assessment responses into OCEAN dimension scores
- Implements reverse scoring for negative trait questions 
- Calculates trait percentiles and relative strengths
- Maps personality traits to optimal energy levels
- Generates focus pattern recommendations

3. ADHD/ASD Profile Processor (src/components/CognitiveProfiles.tsx)
Importance Score: 85
- Analyzes responses for ADHD tendencies across attention domains
- Evaluates ASD indicators for sensory sensitivity
- Calculates focus masking requirements
- Maps cognitive patterns to music parameter recommendations
- Determines optimal stimulation levels

4. Channel Matching Algorithm (src/lib/channelMatcher.ts)
Importance Score: 80
- Maps cognitive profiles to channel recommendations
- Weights channels based on:
  - Brain type compatibility
  - ADHD/ASD sensitivity needs
  - Energy level requirements
  - Focus enhancement patterns
- Generates personalized channel priority lists

Core Logic Flows:
- Quiz response processing → OCEAN scoring → Brain type determination
- Cognitive profile generation → Channel matching → Music recommendations
- Sensitivity assessment → Parameter tuning → Focus optimization
