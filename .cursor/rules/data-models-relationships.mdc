Core Data Models:

1. Cognitive Profile Model (Importance: 95/100)
- Primary brain type classification
- Secondary brain type indicators
- OCEAN personality trait scores
- ADHD/ASD sensitivity levels
- Stimulant response patterns
- Energy level preferences
- Channel recommendations mapping

2. Audio Channel Model (Importance: 90/100)
- Channel categorization by cognitive impact
- Energy level tiers (low/medium/high)
- Associated brain type mappings
- Track inclusion rules
- Default slot strategies

3. Track Metadata Model (Importance: 85/100)
- Musical characteristics (speed, intensity, brightness)
- Psychological factors (arousal, valence)
- Energy classification
- Channel assignments
- Version tracking
- CDN storage locations

4. Slot Strategy Model (Importance: 90/100)
- Rule group definitions
- Target value ranges
- Boost weight configurations
- Track selection criteria
- Energy progression patterns
- Channel-specific overrides

5. User Playlist Model (Importance: 80/100)
- Brain type associations
- Channel preferences
- Energy level history
- Track completion patterns
- Skip behavior tracking
- Session analytics

Key Relationships:
- Users -> Cognitive Profiles (1:1)
- Cognitive Profiles -> Channel Recommendations (1:N)
- Channels -> Tracks (1:N)
- Channels -> Slot Strategies (1:N)
- Tracks -> Playlists (N:M)
- Users -> Playlists (1:N)

The system implements a sophisticated relationship model centered around matching cognitive profiles to audio content through channel-based organization and slot-based sequencing strategies.
